# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It is a basic app which fetches data from openweathermap.org in JSON format, allowing us to retrieve the weather of our desired city.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
